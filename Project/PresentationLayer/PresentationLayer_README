Description:
	Contains the main driver in GUI.java. Uses
javax.swing objects to create GUI elements. Communicates with the LogicLayer using
accessor/mutator methods to manipulate/access data. Also
accesses DataLayer to import / export database when necessary. We will
import the database to a local HashTable() object and will export when any data
has been manipulated or created. We use the Mediator pattern in this Layer to
allow all of the different panels to communicate easily. The Mediator is GUI.java,
and all of the colleagues are the different panels. We pass an object of GUI.java (the Mediator)
into the constructor of all of our colleagues (the other panels). Then when we
want to update something on another panel, we go through the GUI object that
was passed into the constructor.
