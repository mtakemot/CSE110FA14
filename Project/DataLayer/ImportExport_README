 Description:
 	This is the DataLayer, and conatins a single class, ImportExport to
store and retrieve our data. All possible errors in read/write will be checked in the
methods written here so that other classes do not have to worry about it, and
can freely call/delegate control to this class (Rule Object).

Should ONLY be called from classes in Presentation Layer because the main driver
is from the PresentationLayer -> GUI.java. The main driver is the only time when
data access and manipulation occurs, so BOTH import and Export methods will be
called from PresentationLayer.
